When I started my blog back in 2017, I knew very little about managing it, how to reach potential audience, I didn't even have that much inspiration on topics to write about. But from the first day there was one thing very clear: I'd always keep content at the center of what I'm doing. I set out a few rules, and I've noticed they have been invaluable to me over the years. I'd even say that my blog's popularity is thanks to these rules.

So let's make clear what "content is king" is all about.

## Don't write for the sake of writing

I only write when I'm inspired and want to. Many blogging forums and gurus advice to write 40 to 80 posts before even considering promoting your blog. The only thing that advice will give you is a burn out after 20 posts.

Personally I've gone with a month or more of not writing at all. Finally when inspiration hit me I could write two or three posts in a single week. You'll probably get away with a consistent writing schedule for a while, but in the end you'll feel burned out and your content won't be any good.

You can of course be on the lookout for new topics to write about. You keep a backlog of ideas. You can refer to it once that wave of writing energy hits you, but when you don't know what to write about.

By only writing when you want to, you'll write about things your actually passionate about. It's also the best way to learn whether blogging is actually your thing or not. If you're only inspired to write every two years, there are probably better things for you to do.

## Don't bother with a fancy design

People come to your blog to read, that should be your primary motive when designing your blog. Don't bother with fancy bells and whistles, a white sheet of paper with black text is all you need. Choose a font that's readable on all devices and don't go too fancy with it.

You can still add a personal touch by playing around with a highlight color or maybe a more fancy title font; but keep it as simple as possible. Optimise for the writing experience of your readers, they'll thank you for that.

In fact, I'd advice you to subscribe to this free typography course. You'll receive a daily email for one week and it has some great eye-opening insights: [https://betterwebtype.com/](*https://betterwebtype.com/).

If there's one thing I would urge you to remember: don't, I repeat: **don't** have ads or other kinds of call to actions obtrude your content. **Never** bother with popups or modals, keep ads at a minimum and make sure they fit in with your design. Sure it might take longer to make a few bucks at the start, but you'll build a reputation of writing qualitative content. That' way more important in the long run.

## Blog performance

No one likes to wait. Make sure to keep blog performance a number one priority. Ideally you want all your readers to be able to start reading in less than a second. The best approach is to use a static site generator or rely on proper caching (which is harder to do than the first option).

If you decide to include images in your post, make sure they are [optimised](*/blog/responsive-images-done-right)!

Prevent scripts from blocking the main render thread, and use tools like [Lighthouse](*https://developers.google.com/web/tools/lighthouse) to analyse what can be improved.

## Write plain English

I'm no native English speaker and I know that my writing isn't of the highest quality. That shouldn't prevent you from building a great blog though. I'd advice to stick to the [Plain English](*http://www.plainenglish.co.uk/how-to-write-in-plain-english.html) guidelines. They teach you how to write in a simple, yet understandable way.

It doesn't matter if you're not the most eloquent writer; if you can get your point across in a clear way, that's all that matters to your readers.

## More than a collection of posts

I try to think of my blog as more than a collection of individual posts. When I write I usually refer to at least a couple of other posts, I'm always thinking about connections between my posts.

In fact, I often even revisit my older posts. I'll update them when I gained new insights on their specific topic, I list references to new posts, or to external resources. I try to keep my posts alive and connected. Sure, I don't do this for _all_ of them, but I have a pretty good feeling about which ones are worth polishing, and which are not; but that's a topic for an upcoming chapter.

For more than three years, I've kept to this one simple rule: content above all else. It's not only my guiding rule when writing, but it'll also be the primary thought throughout this series. Of course you'll need ways to promote and monetise your blog. And that's entirely possible all while keeping your content king.
