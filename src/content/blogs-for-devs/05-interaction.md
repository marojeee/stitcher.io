An experience blogger once told me that I should think of my blog as more than "just a blog". If we're speaking in terms of sales, my blog isn't the product, I am. I'm selling myself, my ideas; my blog just happens to be one way of doing it.

Honestly I don't really like that analogy too much. It makes me feel like a blog is all about making money, and that my audience is just the means to that money. For me, money has never been the goal of why I write. Don't get me wrong: it's nice to earn a little by doing what I love, but it has never been my primary goal. In fact, I also love my daytime job and wouldn't want to be a full-time blogger at all.

That's why I think interaction, genuine interaction, is important. Building long-lasting, meaningful connections. I'm thankful to the people who make the effort to tell me they enjoyed a post of mine, how it inspired them. My audience are people just like me, not money-making machines.

I realise this attitude might not be the fastest or best way to monetise my blog, but it's one of the core values I'll stick with. I also believe it helps me keep write quality content, instead of falling in the trap of writing crappy stuff just to earn more money.

I believe that interaction with my audience is an integral part of my blog. It takes as much time, if not more, as writing itself. I consider it "part of the job", or I should better say "part of the hobby".

Of course, it's not possible to stay in touch with people throughout all channels. I listed several categories of channels in [the previous chapter](*/blogs-for-devs/04-your-audience#don't-limit-yourself), and I admit that I'm not able to interact with people on all of them.

I do indeed use some channels to just push my content out to the world. I do try to read all comments, but I'm not able to react to all of them. No shame in that though, I always make sure to mention where people can reach me if they really want to. Like via [Twitter](*https://twitter.com/brendt_gd) or via [e-mail](mailto:brendt@stitcher.io).

- Engaging with your audience through different channels of social media takes as much time, if not more, as writing content. This is part of the job.
- Don't use social media to only promote your content, share other people's content, get truly involved.
- Being involved also means you'll have to challenge yourself to read more other sources. This can be an inspiration, but also confront you with things you might not have done very well. It's a great learning experience
